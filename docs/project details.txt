📱 Project Name (Example): AI Study Hub

    An affordable all‑in‑one study assistant for students in Bangladesh, powered by the latest AI models (GPT‑4, Claude, Gemini).

👩‍🎓 What is it?

AI Study Hub is a mobile app where students can:

    Ask questions about homework & assignments.
    Upload PDFs (class notes, research articles) → get summaries & answers.
    Take a photo of their problem (math/physics question, diagram) → get explanations.
    Generate diagrams, posters, or videos for projects (optional premium).

The app gives access to the world’s top AI models like GPT‑4, Claude 3, and Google Gemini — but students don’t need international cards or subscriptions in USD. They can simply pay with bKash/Nagad in Bangladeshi Taka and use it instantly.
💡 How does it work? (Simple Flow)

    Students top up credits in the app (like mobile talk‑time):
        Example: Buy 100 credits for 100 BDT using bKash.

    Credits = currency inside app. Students spend these credits on different AI services:
        2 credits → Ask a tough GPT‑4 question.
        1 credit → Get a quick summary from Gemini.
        3 credits → Solve a math problem from a photo.
        5 credits → Generate an image for a project poster.
        50 credits → Generate a 10‑second AI video.

    The app connects to multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) to get the answers.
        Students see results inside the app.
        They don’t need to know which company’s AI is used — they just get the solution.

    Every request costs credits. Credits ensure students only pay for what they use, and the business (you) always covers costs while keeping profit.

💰 How does the business make money?

    Each AI model costs a small amount when used (e.g., GPT‑4 may cost you 1–2 BDT per answer).
    You charge students a little higher (e.g., 3–5 credits = 3–5 BDT for that same GPT‑4 answer).
    The difference between what the provider charges you and what you charge the student = your profit margin.

Example:

    A student asks 100 questions in a day.
    Provider cost = 150 BDT.
    You charge credits worth = 200 BDT.
    Your margin = 50 BDT profit from one user that day.

Multiply this by hundreds or thousands of students → steady revenue.
📊 Why does it work for students?

    🧾 Affordable: Students can spend as little as 10–20 BDT at a time.
    📚 All models in one app: They don’t need multiple subscriptions/accounts.
    💳 Local payment: Pay with bKash/Nagad in Bangladeshi Taka, no card needed.
    🎓 Focused on learning: Features are designed for their needs: PDFs, math help, diagrams, summaries.

⚙️ Behind the Scenes (Simplified for Non‑Tech Person)

Think of the app like a middleman:

    Student asks questions → App forwards it to the best AI model.
    The AI replies → App shows it nicely to the student.
    Each time this happens:
        App deducts credits from the student’s balance.
        App pays the AI provider the small underlying cost.
        App keeps the markup margin as profit.

🔐 Good Business Practices

    🛡️ Protect against abuse: student can’t spam unlimited free requests.
    📊 Track usage: know what features are most used (PDF vs chat vs image).
    ⏳ Credits expire after some time (e.g., 90 days) to encourage repeat top‑ups.
    🎁 Retain students with small free credits daily (“Sign in today, get 2 credits!”).

🏦 Revenue Model (simple numbers)

    Top‑up Packs:
        50 credits = 50 BDT
        100 credits = 95 BDT (discount)
        300 credits = 270 BDT

    Sample Costs vs. Prices:
        GPT‑4 question costs you ~1.5 BDT → You charge 3 credits (3 BDT).
        Image generation costs you 5 BDT → You charge 7–10 credits.
        Video 5s costs you 40–50 BDT → You charge 60 credits.

So every transaction guarantees a 25–50% margin.
🚀 Growth Potential

    Student Market: Bangladesh has millions of high‑school & university students struggling with English, science, math — perfect audience.
    Local Payment Advantage: International subscriptions are hard; you bridge the gap.
    Upsell Features: After core study tools, you can add premium services:
        AI voice teacher (credits per lesson)
        AI writing assistant (essays, reports)
        AI presentation maker
